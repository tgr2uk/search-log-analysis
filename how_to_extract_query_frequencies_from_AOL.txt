How to extract a query frequency list from AOL

Extract queries from the log, i.e. the 2nd field:
> awk 'BEGIN { FS = "\t" } ; { print $2 }' fullcollection.txt > aolquerylist.txt

Note that technically the 2nd field contains the query, but this does NOT imply
that the user’s action was necessarily a query (it could have been a click
or page operation). So it’s an open question whether the query list from which stats
are generated should contain ONLY those which we know are query actions, i.e. 
we ignore any queries that are part of page or click actions. 

We’ll keep it inclusive/simple for now, and extract ALL queries. 

Now sort the output
> sort aolquerylist.txt > j2

The merge and count the lines:
> uniq -c j2 > j3

And sort in descending order:
> sort -rn j3 > j4

You can of course do all this in one line:
> sort j | uniq -c | sort -rn
 
Replacing the space delimiter with a comma makes subsequent processing easier:
> cat > j.awk
# reformat a query wfl to facilitate reading into Python as a dict

BEGIN { print "query,freq" }

{
    freq = $1
    sub(/ *[0-9]+ /, "");
    query = $0
    printf "%s,%d\n", query, freq
}

> awk -f j.awk j4 > j5

> mv j5 aolquerylist.csv
